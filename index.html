    <h2 class="Subtitle">Our Ambitions:</h2>

    <div class="Text">
        As a domestic internment camp, we aim to utilize the least of resources humanly possible to feed our <em>lovely</em> overpopulating corporate slaves. 
        By doing so, we will save on produce and meal production expenses, further incrementing profits from laboring in our local coal and nickel mines. 
        Through this website, we can provide not only our local supremacist community with these ingredient-rudimentary recipes, but we can help other slave
        provide their prisoners more cheaper and profitting meals, one recipe at a time.
