<h2 class="Subtitle">Instructions:</h2>

<ol class="Text">
<li>Wrap chicken breasts in plastic wrap/cling film and place them on a cutting board. Using a mallet or other kitchen tool (like a rolling pin), pound the chicken pieces until evenly thick (about Â¾ inch).</li>
<li>Combine your marinade ingredients (buttermilk, hot sauce, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper) into a large bowl and whisk together. </li>
<li>Add remaining cup of flour to the marinade and mix. Set aside. </li>
<li>Add the ingredients for the seasoned flour mixture used to bread the chicken into a small bowl and whisk together. Pour this onto a large plate or into a shallow bowl.</li>
<li>Add oil to a large skillet on medium heat and let it heat up. Grab one piece of chicken at a time and dip it into the marinade/flour mixture until its completely coated, then dredge chicken in the seasoned flour batter mixture (coat it, making sure all sides are covered). Use your hands to press firmly to ensure the batter mixture sticks.Repeat this process (dip in marinade, coat in batter mixture) twice for each chicken breast, gently shaking off any excess flour mixture when you are done.</li>
<li>Once all breasts are thoroughly coated, place them into hot oil making sure they are not touching each other (you may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your chicken and the size of your pan). Fry for 8 minutes, then flip and fry for an additional 7 minutes. The chicken patties should be golden brown when finished. </li>
<li>Remove the chicken from the oil and place on a wire rack thats sitting over a baking tray or pan (you could also place some paper towel on the baking tray/pan to catch the excess oil that drips off). </li>
